# Boti's Button Board
This is a simple app which allows you to create a series of buttons which can be set to overwrite specific files. Originally made for a friend who wanted a simple way to update some files for his Twitch stream. I thought I'd release the code in case it's useful for somebody else. When the buttons are pressed, the file is overwritten with the specified text.
